What does fopen do? What are its parameters?

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);
```

`fopen` opens a file and returns FILE* to handle it.
It's a library function that wraps arounds the open system call.

Example:
FILE *stream = fopen("README.md", "a+");

fprintf - takes a FILE*
fscanf - takes a FILE*
